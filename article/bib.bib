abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to ad- vances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive re- search and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient com- putational (recursive) solution of the least-squares method. The filter is very pow- erful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is un- known. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kal- man filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extend- ed Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

abstract = {In probabilistic mobile robot localization, the development of the$\backslash$nsensor model plays a crucial role as it directly influences the efficiency$\backslash$nand the robustness of the localization process. Sensor models developed$\backslash$nfor particle filters compute the likelihood of a sensor measurement$\backslash$nby assuming that one of the particles accurately represents the true$\backslash$nlocation of the robot. In practice, however, this assumption is often$\backslash$nstrongly violated, especially when using small sample sets or during$\backslash$nglobal localization. In this paper we introduce a novel, adaptive$\backslash$nsensor model that explicitly takes the limited representational power$\backslash$nof particle filters into account. As a result, our approach uses$\backslash$nsmooth likelihood functions during global localization and more peaked$\backslash$nfunctions during position tracking. Experiments show that our technique$\backslash$nsignificantly outperforms existing, static sensor models.},

@article{Celan2016,
abstract = {The paper describes design and features of novel semi-autonomous floor
scrubber add-on module, used for cleaning large indoor and outdoor
tile/marbles spaces found in modern (smart) cities. Module is designed
in such a manner that it can be easily added to and removed from
scrubber machine and that additional sensors and capabilities can be
introduced (modular design). In the paper localization capabilities of
the machine in three sensor setups are presented and analyzed. Analysis
is performed in terms of localization accuracy and reliability as well
as associated advantages and disadvantages. Obtained results
demonstrated that inclusion of UWB subsystem, despite its price and
accuracy (+/- 20 cm in ideal, line of sight, conditions), yields more
reliable and accurate results in open spaces (up to 25 times in position
and 2 times in orientation) where performance of used Lidar might be
sub-optimal.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {In transporter associated with antigen-processing (TAP)-deficient patients affected by a severe downmodulation of human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules, natural killer (NK) cells have an increased expression of the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A. Focusing our attention on NK cells, we have investigated the phenotype, function and proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) derived from healthy donors after coculturing with TAP (T2)- or HLA-I-deficient (721.221) cell lines and their related HLA-I-expressing transfectants (T3 and DT360, respectively). After 4 days, NK cells cocultured with T2 cells had a threefold increased CD94 expression compared to NK cells cocultured with T3. This increase was due to proliferation of the CD56brightCD94bright subset. In contrast, expression of other inhibitory receptors [killer cell immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors] was variable during time and was not related to HLA-I molecules expressed by stimulating cells. Similar results were obtained using HLA-I-deficient cells (721.221). The PBLs cocultured for 4 days with T2 cells displayed enhanced cytotoxic responses. The results suggest that CD56brightCD94bright NK cells are induced to proliferate and kill in response to a TAP-deficient environment. The changes seen in the NK-cell compartment were partially contributed by T lymphocytes present in the coculture. These data could explain the increased CD94 expression and autoimmune manifestations observed in TAP-deficient patients.},

@article{Fox1999,
abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for mobile robot lo- calization, called Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). MCL is a version of Markov localization, a family of probabilis- tic approaches that have recently been applied with great practical success. However, previous approaches were ei- ther computationally cumbersome (such as grid-based ap- proaches that represent the state space by high-resolution 3D grids), or had to resort to extremely coarse-grained res- olutions. Our approach is computationally efficient while retaining the ability to represent (almost) arbitrary distri- butions. MCL applies sampling-based methods for approx- imating probability distributions, in a way that places com- putation“where needed.” The number of samples is adapted on-line, thereby invoking large sample sets only when neces- sary. Empirical results illustrate that MCL yields improved accuracy while requiring an order of magnitude less com- putation when compared to previous approaches. It is also much easier to implement.},
